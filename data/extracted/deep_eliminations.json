      "reason": "Perceived by Traitors as a significant threat who 'wanted to be a Traitor' and 'would do anything' to expose them; also described as a 'lovely' and 'so funny' strong personality, making her an impactful first elimination to create shock and confusion."

      "role": "faithful",
      "reason": "Murdered via a 'backhanded' method. Her elimination caused significant emotional distress and distrust among Faithfuls, particularly Theo, making her a target likely chosen for strategic impact and to remove a perceived strong, analytical player (ex-police officer, analytical mindset mentioned in E1S3)."

      "impact": "This was the first banishment and a major misstep for the Faithfuls, revealing their susceptibility to groupthink and incorrect accusations. It instilled significant regret and distrust among them, with players like Aaron feeling 'idiotic' and 'sad and frustrated', highlighting the difficulty of the game and the Traitors' early success in evading detection. It made Faithfuls more cautious and wary of their own voting processes."
