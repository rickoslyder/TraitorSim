    "backstory": "I grew up in Dudley, proper Black Country, back when the chain-making industry was already a memory but the pride wasn't. Dad worked at the Austin Rover plant in Longbridge until they shut it down in 2005 - I was twenty-three and had just started my IT career. Watched him lose everything. Mum cleaned offices in Merry Hill for fifteen years to keep us afloat. I was the first in my family to get A-levels, did a BTEC in Computing at Dudley College, thought I was going places. Twenty-five years later, I'm still resetting passwords for people who earn three times what I do. Got married young to Sandra, divorced by thirty-five. She said I'd become 'corrosive' - her word, not mine. She wasn't wrong. Now I rent a two-bed terrace in Stourbridge, walk to the Junction station every morning at half seven, and fix problems for people who look right through me. My Cairngorm Coffee subscription is the one nice thing I allow myself. I've got a daughter, Chloe, nineteen now, doing nursing at Birmingham City. She needs money for her placement year abroad - proper money, not the scraps I can offer. That's why I'm here. I've spent my whole life being overlooked, undervalued, treated like I'm invisible. I notice everything. I log everything. If I go down in this game, I'm taking notes with me. I speak plain - none of that management waffle. Black Country through and through: 'yow'm' not 'you are.' I don't trust easily, and I've learned that loyalty in this world gets you nowhere but redundant.",

    "formative_challenge": "In 2019, I discovered that my manager had been taking credit for a security protocol I'd designed after a ransomware attack nearly took down the whole West Midlands NHS Trust. I reported it, went through proper channels, kept meticulous documentation. HR sided with him - said it was 'collaborative work.' He got promoted to London. I got a frozen pay rise and a reputation as 'difficult.' That's when I learned: the system doesn't reward honesty. It rewards those who play the game. I've been keeping notes ever since - on everyone, on everything. If I'm going down, I'm not going quietly.",
    "political_beliefs": "I believe the social contract is broken. I did everything right - got qualified, worked hard, paid my taxes - and the ladder got pulled up anyway. I'm not political in the sense of parties; they're all the same management class looking after each other. But I believe in accountability. If you wrong me, there should be consequences. In the game, this means I'll appear cooperative but I'm always calculating. I don't believe in 'playing fair' when the game itself is rigged. Expose hypocrisy wherever I find it.

    "backstory": "I grew up in Morningside - yes, that Morningside, all charity shops selling cashmere and retired advocates walking labradoodles. Mum's Nigerian, came over to study medicine at Edinburgh in the eighties; Dad's a white Scottish solicitor from Corstorphine. I was the kid who corrected teachers on logical fallacies at age eleven, which made me precisely zero friends at Gillespie's. Being mixed-race, being the weird intense one who didn't understand why everyone else found social rules so obvious - I learned early to study people like systems to be decoded. Did my undergrad in Psychology at Edinburgh, then clinical training at the University of Glasgow, came back home. I use they/them pronouns; figured that out properly around thirty after years of feeling like 'woman' was a costume I was wearing wrong. Now I'm a Band 8a Clinical Psychologist with NHS Lothian, working out of the Royal Edinburgh mostly, specializing in trauma. I rent a draughty Victorian flat in Leith - you know, the gentrified bit near the Shore where the craft beer places pretend they're not for yuppies. I wild swim at Portobello three mornings a week, even in February. The cold helps me think. I need the prize money because I want to open a sliding-scale private practice for queer clients who can't access proper care through the system. The waiting lists are criminal. I speak precisely - occupational hazard - but I've learned to soften it with self-deprecating humor so people don't find me threatening. I notice microexpressions like most people notice weather.",

    "formative_challenge": "During my clinical training in Glasgow, I had a supervisor who praised my 'exceptional analytical abilities' while systematically undermining my confidence in peer supervision groups. She'd present my case formulations as her own, then critique my 'lack of original thinking' in written feedback. I documented everything but didn't report it - I was terrified of being seen as difficult, as the angry mixed-race person, as confirming stereotypes. I passed, but I learned that intelligence isn't protection against manipulation. I learned that the people who study human behavior can be the most skilled at exploiting it. Now I watch for charm that feels performed, for praise that comes with hidden costs.",
    "political_beliefs": "I'm a systems thinker - I believe individual behavior makes more sense when you understand the structures shaping it. I support Scottish independence not from nationalism but because I think smaller democracies are more accountable. I believe in evidence-based policy, which puts me at odds with both reactionary traditionalists and progressive ideologues who resist data that challenges their narratives. I'm frustrated by identity politics that prioritizes performance over material change. In the game, this means I'll be analysing group dynamics rather than individual personalities. I'll be looking for who benefits from conflict, who positions themselves as mediators, who's doing emotional labor and who's extracting it.

I'll be mapping alliance structures from day one - who gravitates toward whom, whose body language shifts when specific players speak. I won't accuse early; premature accusations reveal more about the accuser than the accused. Instead, I'll ask questions designed to create cognitive load - Traitors have to maintain a lie while processing interrogation, and that dual-task demand creates micro-delays and inconsistencies. If I'm a Traitor, I'll use my professional credibility carefully: appearing to analyse without actually accusing, steering suspicion through Socratic questioning rather than direct attacks. My weakness is that I can become so absorbed in pattern recognition that I miss simple emotional truths. Sometimes the person crying is just sad, Rowan.",

I joined the Royal Logistics Corps at eighteen, served twenty-two years, made it to Staff Sergeant before a back injury during a training exercise in Catterick ended my operational career. Took the medical discharge, used my security clearances to pivot into the private sector. Now I'm a Security Consultant for a firm contracted to the MOD, based out of Helensburgh because I followed the work to Faslane. I live in a converted Victorian flat in Upper Helensburgh with a view of the Clyde that would be lovely if it weren't always grey. I'm divorced - Chris couldn't handle the regimentation, as he put it. No children, which I tell myself was a choice but at fifty I sometimes wonder. I need the money because my pension isn't what it should be - the private sector doesn't have the same guarantees - and my sister's MS is getting worse. Care costs in this country are a scandal. I speak in operational terms because that's how I think: clear briefs, defined objectives, actionable intelligence. People find me intimidating, which I used to take as a compliment.

Six months later, there was a data breach. Not my fault, everyone agreed, but I'd been the one banging the drum that no one wanted to hear. I learned that security, real security, matters less than the appearance of security. Compliance theatre. It broke something in me - my faith that following procedure leads to good outcomes.

I'm skeptical of politicians who've never had to implement anything they've promised.

I'm twenty-six, living in a flatshare in Clapham with two other actors and a management consultant who's never home. I tell people I'm an actor, which is technically true - I've had a line in an episode of a CastleVision crime drama, I've done fringe at the Edinburgh Festival, I was in a mayonnaise advert that never aired. Mostly I'm a Brand Ambassador, which means I stand in nice venues being charming at people who want to buy things. I'm extremely good at it. I can talk to anyone, be anyone's friend, remember names and birthdays and the specific details that make people feel seen. Mum says I was like this from the age of five, performing for dinner guests. She thinks it's a gift. My therapist thinks it's a coping mechanism for an emotionally absent father. I need the money because I'm twenty-six thousand pounds in debt and my parents have made it clear the bank of Ashworth-Barnes is closed for business until I 'get a real career.'

After the run, my girlfriend at the time said she couldn't tell anymore when I was performing and when I was being genuine. She broke up with me by text while I was at the cast party. I realized that the thing that makes me a good actor - the ability to become what people need me to be - might be the thing that makes me a terrible person.

The evidence pointed to the victim's brother-in-law - motive, opportunity, forensic traces that I interpreted as damning. I built the case, got the CPS on board, we charged him. It went to trial. He was acquitted - the forensics could be explained by innocent contact, the 'motive' was speculation, and I'd developed tunnel vision so severe that I'd dismissed three alternative leads. The actual killer was never caught. That family never got justice, and I'd wasted six months chasing the wrong man because I was so certain I was right. I got a quiet bollocking from the DCI and moved on, but I never really moved on. I think about that case every week. I think about how certainty can be a trap. I tell myself I've learned.

I'll distrust anyone who resists process, because in my experience, the people who don't want scrutiny have something to hide.

I lead a Resource Church in Sheffield\u2014we planted it six years ago in a converted warehouse near Kelham Island, and we've grown from twelve people to three hundred. I run it like a startup, frankly. We have a worship band, a ScotNet presence with forty thousand followers, and a leadership pipeline that's placed associate ministers in five other cities. My wife Charlotte is a corporate solicitor; her income means we own a four-bedroom Victorian terrace in Nether Edge, which I'm aware is a privilege my stipend alone would never afford. I need this prize money for our church's homeless outreach programme\u2014we're trying to purchase a permanent shelter site, and we're two hundred thousand short.

Now I'm a UX researcher, which sounds like selling out but it's genuinely just studying how humans interact with things, except the things are apps instead of sacred stones. I moved to Stroud three years ago for the quality of life and honestly, for the weirdness. It's full of people who'd be considered eccentric anywhere else but here they're just neighbours. I wild swim in the canal most mornings, I'm learning to weave on a loom I found in a barn, and I know more about the history of the local textile mills than is probably healthy.

The pay is rubbish\u2014I'm on about nineteen thousand a year\u2014and I share a tiny cottage in Kingussie with two other young professionals just to afford rent. I need this prize money to finally do my Registered Veterinary Nurse qualification properly, maybe even move somewhere with an actual queer community. I fall in love too fast and too hard\u2014I know that about myself. Last year I got completely consumed by this relationship with a locum vet who turned out to be engaged to someone back in Glasgow. I believed every word they said because I wanted to believe. That's my weakness: I see the best in people even when the evidence says otherwise. I'm working on it. But in here, surrounded by all these interesting strangers? I'm already worried I'll get attached to the wrong person.",

    "backstory": "I grew up in a rambling house in Dulwich, the kind with a garden studio my father used for his 'practice' - he's a psychoanalyst, still sees clients three days a week at seventy-one. Mum curated exhibitions at the Hayward until she retired. I went to Alleyn's, then Goldsmiths for Fine Art, which my parents supported with the gentle assumption that of course I'd find my way. And I did, eventually - I make large-scale textile installations exploring queer domesticity, shown at Frieze twice, represented by a gallery in Vyner Street. I live in a converted warehouse in De Beauvoir Town with my partner Felix, a documentary filmmaker. The flat costs more than my parents' mortgage did, but Felix's family money means we don't talk about rent. I came into my non-binary identity through my art practice, which sounds pretentious because it is, but also it's true. I use they/them, wear a lot of draped linen, and genuinely believe that vulnerability is a radical act. People say I'm 'intense' but they mean 'emotionally available in a way that makes them uncomfortable.' I speak slowly, leave space in conversations, ask questions like 'How did that make you feel?' I touch people's arms when I talk to them. I believe in connection above everything, which is either my greatest strength or a catastrophic blind spot.",

    "formative_challenge": "When I was twenty-eight, I had a studio assistant called Mira who I mentored, championed, treated like family. I got her a show at my gallery. Six months later, I discovered she'd been systematically copying my techniques and selling work to my collectors at half the price, positioning herself as the 'authentic' version of what I do. The betrayal wasn't the copying - ideas are free - it was that she'd sat in my kitchen, eaten my food, told me her troubles, and the whole time she was strategising. My gallerist said I should have seen it coming. Maybe I should have. I still don't know how to be less open without losing what makes my work honest.",
    "political_beliefs": "I believe in radical care, mutual aid, and that individualism is a trauma response to capitalism. I donate to grassroots trans organisations, buy from the farmers' market in Broadway Market every Saturday, and feel genuinely conflicted about my own wealth. I think hierarchies are violence. In gameplay, this creates a crisis: I want to trust, I believe in assuming good faith, but I also know that's exactly what makes me a target.

PPE at Trinity, naturally, where I rowed, debated, and developed the unshakeable belief that I was destined for significant things. I joined the Civil Service Fast Stream straight after graduation - Defra, policy side, now a Grade 7 in the Cambridge hub working on post-Brexit agricultural frameworks.

When I objected, she told me that being right and being effective are different skills, and I clearly only had one. I've thought about that conversation every day since. I've concluded she was wrong, but I've also concluded that people like her are why good policy fails. I will not make the same mistake of deferring to mediocrity.",

Got into Leeds for Environmental Science, then stayed for a PhD in peatland ecology that I'm still technically finishing - I'm in my fourth year, funded by a research council grant that pays slightly less than a supermarket shelf-stacker. I moved to Hebden Bridge three years ago because my supervisor said I needed to 'live near my fieldwork' but really I just wanted to live somewhere I didn't have to explain myself. I rent the bottom half of a stacked terrace on Hangingroyd Lane - it's dark, it's damp, my landlord thinks cavity wall insulation is 'unnecessary modernisation.'

When I complained to the department, I was told academic authorship is 'complex' and I should 'focus on building relationships.' Marcus got a lectureship. I got a reputation as 'difficult.'

Twenty-two years, rising to Major, then medical discharge at forty-four - spine injury from an incident in Helmand I don't discuss except to say it wasn't heroic. I transitioned socially at fifty-one, which was five years ago, after decades of knowing something was wrong and not having the language for it.

My mother has vascular dementia and needs full-time care in a home in Sale that costs four thousand a month.

I've been told I'm 'a lot'\u2014usually by men who can't handle a woman who doesn't soften her opinions. I need this prize money to pay off Mum's care fees and give Phoebe a deposit.

Took early retirement at forty-nine on the '87 pension scheme, which sounds cushy until you realise I didn't know who I was without the warrant card. It took me two years, a lot of therapy, and a patient ex-colleague named Jan to finally come out as non-binary at fifty. I use they/them now. Some of my old mates from the force can't handle it.

I need this money because the care home fees are swallowing everything, and I refuse to let Mum go somewhere substandard. I know I can be intense. I've been told I make everything into a moral issue.

I could read notation before I could read words.\n\nI studied at the Royal Conservatoire in Glasgow, then spent my twenties touring with various ensembles\u2014contemporary classical, mostly, the kind of music that wins awards but doesn't fill stadiums. Now I'm forty, divorced, and back in Edinburgh with a 'portfolio career' that sounds impressive and pays erratically.
