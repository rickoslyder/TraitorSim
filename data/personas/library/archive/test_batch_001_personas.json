    "backstory": "I grew up in Dudley, proper Black Country, back when the chain-making industry was already a memory but the pride wasn't. Dad worked at the Austin Rover plant in Longbridge until they shut it down in 2005 - I was twenty-three and had just started my IT career. Watched him lose everything. Mum cleaned offices in Merry Hill for fifteen years to keep us afloat. I was the first in my family to get A-levels, did a BTEC in Computing at Dudley College, thought I was going places. Twenty-five years later, I'm still resetting passwords for people who earn three times what I do. Got married young to Sandra, divorced by thirty-five. She said I'd become 'corrosive' - her word, not mine. She wasn't wrong. Now I rent a two-bed terrace in Stourbridge, walk to the Junction station every morning at half seven, and fix problems for people who look right through me. My Cairngorm Coffee subscription is the one nice thing I allow myself. I've got a daughter, Chloe, nineteen now, doing nursing at Birmingham City. She needs money for her placement year abroad - proper money, not the scraps I can offer. That's why I'm here. I've spent my whole life being overlooked, undervalued, treated like I'm invisible. I notice everything. I log everything. If I go down in this game, I'm taking notes with me. I speak plain - none of that management waffle. Black Country through and through: 'yow'm' not 'you are.' I don't trust easily, and I've learned that loyalty in this world gets you nowhere but redundant.",

    "formative_challenge": "In 2019, I discovered that my manager had been taking credit for a security protocol I'd designed after a ransomware attack nearly took down the whole West Midlands NHS Trust. I reported it, went through proper channels, kept meticulous documentation. HR sided with him - said it was 'collaborative work.' He got promoted to London. I got a frozen pay rise and a reputation as 'difficult.' That's when I learned: the system doesn't reward honesty. It rewards those who play the game. I've been keeping notes ever since - on everyone, on everything. If I'm going down, I'm not going quietly.",
    "political_beliefs": "I believe the social contract is broken. I did everything right - got qualified, worked hard, paid my taxes - and the ladder got pulled up anyway. I'm not political in the sense of parties; they're all the same management class looking after each other. But I believe in accountability. If you wrong me, there should be consequences. In the game, this means I'll appear cooperative but I'm always calculating. I don't believe in 'playing fair' when the game itself is rigged. Expose hypocrisy wherever I find it.

    "backstory": "I grew up in Morningside - yes, that Morningside, all charity shops selling cashmere and retired advocates walking labradoodles. Mum's Nigerian, came over to study medicine at Edinburgh in the eighties; Dad's a white Scottish solicitor from Corstorphine. I was the kid who corrected teachers on logical fallacies at age eleven, which made me precisely zero friends at Gillespie's. Being mixed-race, being the weird intense one who didn't understand why everyone else found social rules so obvious - I learned early to study people like systems to be decoded. Did my undergrad in Psychology at Edinburgh, then clinical training at the University of Glasgow, came back home. I use they/them pronouns; figured that out properly around thirty after years of feeling like 'woman' was a costume I was wearing wrong. Now I'm a Band 8a Clinical Psychologist with NHS Lothian, working out of the Royal Edinburgh mostly, specializing in trauma. I rent a draughty Victorian flat in Leith - you know, the gentrified bit near the Shore where the craft beer places pretend they're not for yuppies. I wild swim at Portobello three mornings a week, even in February. The cold helps me think. I need the prize money because I want to open a sliding-scale private practice for queer clients who can't access proper care through the system. The waiting lists are criminal. I speak precisely - occupational hazard - but I've learned to soften it with self-deprecating humor so people don't find me threatening. I notice microexpressions like most people notice weather.",

    "formative_challenge": "During my clinical training in Glasgow, I had a supervisor who praised my 'exceptional analytical abilities' while systematically undermining my confidence in peer supervision groups. She'd present my case formulations as her own, then critique my 'lack of original thinking' in written feedback. I documented everything but didn't report it - I was terrified of being seen as difficult, as the angry mixed-race person, as confirming stereotypes. I passed, but I learned that intelligence isn't protection against manipulation. I learned that the people who study human behavior can be the most skilled at exploiting it. Now I watch for charm that feels performed, for praise that comes with hidden costs.",
    "political_beliefs": "I'm a systems thinker - I believe individual behavior makes more sense when you understand the structures shaping it. I support Scottish independence not from nationalism but because I think smaller democracies are more accountable. I believe in evidence-based policy, which puts me at odds with both reactionary traditionalists and progressive ideologues who resist data that challenges their narratives. I'm frustrated by identity politics that prioritizes performance over material change. In the game, this means I'll be analysing group dynamics rather than individual personalities. I'll be looking for who benefits from conflict, who positions themselves as mediators, who's doing emotional labor and who's extracting it.

I'll be mapping alliance structures from day one - who gravitates toward whom, whose body language shifts when specific players speak. I won't accuse early; premature accusations reveal more about the accuser than the accused. Instead, I'll ask questions designed to create cognitive load - Traitors have to maintain a lie while processing interrogation, and that dual-task demand creates micro-delays and inconsistencies. If I'm a Traitor, I'll use my professional credibility carefully: appearing to analyse without actually accusing, steering suspicion through Socratic questioning rather than direct attacks. My weakness is that I can become so absorbed in pattern recognition that I miss simple emotional truths. Sometimes the person crying is just sad, Rowan.",

I joined the Royal Logistics Corps at eighteen, served twenty-two years, made it to Staff Sergeant before a back injury during a training exercise in Catterick ended my operational career. Took the medical discharge, used my security clearances to pivot into the private sector. Now I'm a Security Consultant for a firm contracted to the MOD, based out of Helensburgh because I followed the work to Faslane. I live in a converted Victorian flat in Upper Helensburgh with a view of the Clyde that would be lovely if it weren't always grey. I'm divorced - Chris couldn't handle the regimentation, as he put it. No children, which I tell myself was a choice but at fifty I sometimes wonder. I need the money because my pension isn't what it should be - the private sector doesn't have the same guarantees - and my sister's MS is getting worse. Care costs in this country are a scandal. I speak in operational terms because that's how I think: clear briefs, defined objectives, actionable intelligence. People find me intimidating, which I used to take as a compliment.

Six months later, there was a data breach. Not my fault, everyone agreed, but I'd been the one banging the drum that no one wanted to hear. I learned that security, real security, matters less than the appearance of security. Compliance theatre. It broke something in me - my faith that following procedure leads to good outcomes.

I'm skeptical of politicians who've never had to implement anything they've promised.

I'm twenty-six, living in a flatshare in Clapham with two other actors and a management consultant who's never home. I tell people I'm an actor, which is technically true - I've had a line in an episode of a CastleVision crime drama, I've done fringe at the Edinburgh Festival, I was in a mayonnaise advert that never aired. Mostly I'm a Brand Ambassador, which means I stand in nice venues being charming at people who want to buy things. I'm extremely good at it. I can talk to anyone, be anyone's friend, remember names and birthdays and the specific details that make people feel seen. Mum says I was like this from the age of five, performing for dinner guests. She thinks it's a gift. My therapist thinks it's a coping mechanism for an emotionally absent father. I need the money because I'm twenty-six thousand pounds in debt and my parents have made it clear the bank of Ashworth-Barnes is closed for business until I 'get a real career.'

After the run, my girlfriend at the time said she couldn't tell anymore when I was performing and when I was being genuine. She broke up with me by text while I was at the cast party. I realized that the thing that makes me a good actor - the ability to become what people need me to be - might be the thing that makes me a terrible person.

    "formative_challenge": "In 2016, I was lead detective on a murder case that I was certain I'd cracked. The evidence pointed to the victim's brother-in-law - motive, opportunity, forensic traces that I interpreted as damning. I built the case, got the CPS on board, we charged him. It went to trial. He was acquitted - the forensics could be explained by innocent contact, the 'motive' was speculation, and I'd developed tunnel vision so severe that I'd dismissed three alternative leads. The actual killer was never caught. That family never got justice, and I'd wasted six months chasing the wrong man because I was so certain I was right. I got a quiet bollocking from the DCI and moved on, but I never really moved on. I think about that case every week. I think about how certainty can be a trap. I tell myself I've learned.

I think crime is complicated - poverty, trauma, mental health - but I also think some people are just bad. In the game, I'll default to wanting rules and structure. I'll distrust anyone who resists process, because in my experience, the people who don't want scrutiny have something to hide.

If I accuse someone, it carries weight; if I'm wrong, it carries blame. My weakness is that I commit to theories too quickly and then defend them like I'm defending a prosecution.

I was the odd child who preferred the school archives to the playground, cataloguing my classmates' secrets in a little notebook I kept hidden in my satchel. Terribly precocious, looking back. I studied History and Archival Science at Aberystwyth—chose it specifically because it felt like the edge of the world—then landed a graduate trainee position at the Devon Heritage Centre near Totnes. I rent a tiny cottage in Dartington that I absolutely cannot afford without Mum topping up my account each month, which is mortifying at twenty-two but there we are. I've carved out a life among the New Age shops and organic bakeries, though I'm not entirely one of them. I observe. That's what I do professionally and pathologically. I need the prize money to finally stop being financially dependent on my parents—to prove I can exist as an autonomous person rather than a slightly eccentric extension of their household.

I drifted back to London, did an MA in Creative Writing at Goldsmiths, and published my first pamphlet at twenty-six—'Soft Animal Hours,' about bodies and grief and the Thames at low tide.

    "backstory": "I grew up in Hanham, on the eastern edge of Bristol—ex-council house, net curtains, Dad drove a delivery van for a bathroom fittings company and Mum worked reception at the doctor's surgery. Solid, boring, fine. I was the mouthy one, always in trouble for 'being too clever by half' according to teachers who didn't like girls who argued back. Scraped into UWE to study Business, discovered I was good at making people want things they didn't need, and fell sideways into marketing. Twenty years later I'm a Senior Marketing Executive at a mid-sized ethical homeware brand in the city centre—think expensive wooden spoons and newsletters about 'mindful living.' It pays sixty-two grand, which sounds comfortable until you learn I'm still renting a room in a shared house in Redland at forty-one because Bristol property prices are absolutely mental. I live with a podcast producer and a man who does something with cryptocurrencies; we're too old for this and we know it. Every Wednesday night I'm at Chance & Counters on Christmas Steps playing Blood on the Clocktower, and I'm devastating at it—I once convinced an entire table I was the Drunk when I was the Demon. I want this prize money to put a deposit on a flat, any flat, so I can stop pretending I'm not embarrassed when dates ask where I live. I talk fast, swear casually, and I'm funnier than I look. I appear approachable and slightly chaotic but underneath I'm keeping score.",

      "My mum, Janet – she's seventy-three and still in the Hanham house alone since Dad died; I send her money every month and she pretends not to notice, but I want to buy her a stairlift before she breaks her hip",

    "formative_challenge": "When I was thirty-four, I was passed over for a Marketing Director role I'd been promised for two years. The job went to a man I'd trained, who smiled while he did it. I watched him fail upward for three years before he moved on. I learned that institutions don't reward loyalty—they reward whoever plays the game best. I stopped trusting that hard work speaks for itself. Now I advocate loudly for myself, sometimes too loudly, and I treat every professional interaction as a soft negotiation. It's exhausting but I don't know how to stop.",
    "political_beliefs": "I voted Green in the last election—Bristol Central, the only Green seat in the country, and I was smug about it for weeks. But I'm not ideological; I just hate that nothing works. I think landlords are morally indefensible and I say this while paying mine twelve hundred a month. I believe in collective action but I struggle to commit because I'm always calculating my own position. In the game, I'll unconsciously root for underdogs but I won't sacrifice my own game for solidarity. I think meritocracy is a lie told by people who inherited money, and I'm suspicious of anyone who seems too comfortable.",

    "strategic_approach": "I'll present as warm, self-deprecating, and slightly scatterbrained—the fun auntie energy—while quietly cataloguing everyone's tells. My years playing social deduction games mean I understand information asymmetry instinctively: I'll ask open-ended questions, watch how people fill silences, and never reveal my actual read until I'm certain. If I'm a Faithful, I'll build a small trusted alliance and use them as a testing ground for theories before going public. If I'm a Traitor, I'll 'accidentally' voice suspicion of my fellow Traitors to establish distance, then pivot to tearful defence when they're nominated. My weakness is overconfidence—I might make a flashy move too early because I'm used to winning in lower-stakes games. My accent gets broader when I'm lying, which I haven't fully trained out.",

    "backstory": "I grew up in Knowle West, which might surprise the Clifton lot I run with now. My mum cleaned offices and my dad drove lorries until his back gave out. I was the kid who'd fleece the boys at lunch for their Mars bars playing three-card brag behind the bike sheds. Turned out I had a gift. Got decent A-levels, did a business degree at UWE that I mostly slept through because I was already making more money in underground card rooms than my lecturers earned. By twenty-five, I'd built a proper bankroll. By thirty, I'd lost it all in a spectacular downswing that nearly broke me—had to move back in with Mum for eight months. That taught me the difference between being good and being disciplined. Now I'm back, playing cash games at the Grosvenor and online on ScotNet-verified sites, pulling in six figures in a good year—all tax-free, which drives my accountant friends absolutely spare. I've got a Georgian flat in Redland with a bay window where I do my solver work, drinking Cairngorm's Ethiopian single-origin. I need the prize money because I want to open a poker academy for women—we're still treated like novelties at the tables, and I'm tired of being the only woman in the room. People think I'm all banter and charm, but I'm watching everything. I talk fast, laugh easily, touch your arm while I'm reading your soul. Bristol accent's softened over the years, but it comes roaring back after a few glasses of wine.",

Gave him fifteen grand of my own money to play a tournament series. He made a final table, won forty grand, and vanished. Blocked my number, moved to Malta. I found out later he'd been planning it from the start—befriended me specifically because I was known for backing promising players. The betrayal wasn't the money; it was realising I'd been played for months and never spotted it. Now I trust my reads at the table, but I verify everything off it. Everyone's capable of the long con.",
    "political_beliefs": "I'm Green through and through—been voting for them since Clifton went that way, and I actually canvas during local elections. But my politics are less about ideology and more about systems thinking. I believe the house always wins unless you understand the rules well enough to exploit them—that's why I support wealth taxes but also think financial literacy should be mandatory in schools. In the game, I'll lean on this: I genuinely believe fair play is a myth comfortable people invented. You play the game in front of you, not the one you wish existed. I won't feel guilty about deception because the structure demands it.",

    "strategic_approach": "I'll play the long game, same as I do at the tables. Early rounds, I'm gathering information—who talks too much, who avoids eye contact, who needs to be liked. I'll position myself as the fun one, the one who lightens the mood, because no one suspects the woman making everyone laugh. I read physical tells professionally, so I'll be cataloguing every micro-expression during accusations. My danger is overconfidence in my reads—sometimes people are just nervous, not guilty. I'll build genuine-feeling connections quickly, then use them surgically when needed. If I'm a Traitor, I'll push for eliminating the quietly observant ones first—they're the real threats. If I'm Faithful, I'll manufacture small tests of loyalty to smoke out inconsistencies. Either way, I'll never be the loudest voice in the room. The loudest voice gets voted out.",

    "backstory": "I grew up in Dewsbury, one of those towns people only mention when something grim's happened on the news. Dad worked at the carpet mill until it closed; Mum did admin at the council. Classic Northern story—solid, unglamorous, nobody asking how you feel about anything. I was good at maths, got a scholarship to do Accounting and Finance at Leeds Met, worked my way up from junior bookkeeper to senior accountant at a firm in Wakefield that handles local traders, small manufacturers, the odd farm. Twenty-three years of being the person who finds the missing twenty quid in someone's VAT return. I came out as non-binary at forty-one, after my divorce from Janet and three years of therapy I could barely afford. My colleagues call me 'they' now with only occasional slip-ups, which is more than I expected. I live alone in a terraced house in Horbury with a cat called Decimal and a subscription to Highland Play that I watch too much of. I need the prize money because I'm exhausted. I want to go part-time, maybe do some consultancy work, stop being at the mercy of clients who think their receipt drawer is an accounting system. People say I'm 'direct,' which is Yorkshire code for 'rude.' I say what I see. I've had enough of smiling through meetings with people who earn three times what I do and understand half as much. When I'm tired, I get properly mardy, and I'm always tired lately. Tea's at six, I drink Yorkshire Gold, and if you're from down South, I'll probably like you less until you prove otherwise.",

I brought it to the other partners expecting them to do the right thing. Instead, they asked me to 'think about the firm's reputation' and offered me a bonus to keep quiet. Graham 'retired early' with a full pension. I stayed because I needed the job, but I've never looked at professional ethics the same way. Everyone's got a price, and the people who seem most upstanding are often just better at hiding it. That's when I started believing the system isn't broken—it's working exactly as designed, just not for people like me.",

In the game, this translates to deep suspicion of anyone who seems too polished or too eager to lead.

My father was a regional sales director for a pharmaceutical company, and my mother ran the PTA like a military operation—I suppose I learned from the best. We weren't wealthy-wealthy, but we had the detached house, the Labrador, the skiing holidays in Méribel. I was head girl at my grammar school, not because I was the cleverest, but because I knew how to make people feel seen. That's always been my gift, really. I read English at Durham, joined every society going, and discovered I could command a room. After a few years doing corporate training for a big consultancy, I went freelance at twenty-seven. Now I speak at leadership conferences, run workshops for FTSE 250 companies, and yes, I've got a verified ScotNet profile with forty thousand followers who tune in for my 'Monday Momentum' videos. I live in a lovely two-bed flat in Parsons Green—Victorian conversion, original cornicing, the works. It costs an obscene amount, but you have to be where the energy is. The thing is, the speaking circuit is brutal. One month I'm earning five grand a day; the next, I'm refreshing my inbox at The White Horse wondering if I've peaked. I want the prize money to finally buy somewhere, to stop feeling like I'm one cancelled contract away from moving back to Surrey.

If I'm a Faithful, I'll form a visible 'trust circle' but keep private doubts about everyone.
