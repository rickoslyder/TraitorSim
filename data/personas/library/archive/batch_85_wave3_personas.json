    "backstory": "I grew up in a semi-detached in Didcot, the kind of place people pass through on the way to somewhere more interesting. Mum worked reception at the John Radcliffe, Dad drove delivery vans. They're still together, still in love after thirty-two years, which I think ruined me a bit\u2014gave me this impossible template for what relationships should look like. I was the girl who cried at Disney films and kept a wedding scrapbook at fourteen, which looking back is slightly mortifying.\n\nI did Events Management at Oxford Brookes, stayed for a placement that turned into a job, and now I run my own wedding planning business from a tiny office above a charity shop in Cowley. People think it's all champagne and cake tastings, but honestly? It's spreadsheets, panicking florists, and talking drunk uncles away from the microphone. I love it though. Every single time the couple does their first dance, I'm in the corner absolutely sobbing into a napkin.\n\nI rent a flat in East Oxford with my friend Priya. I'd love to buy, but have you seen house prices here? The prize money could actually get me on the ladder, maybe even a little cottage in Headington with a garden for my dog I don't have yet.\n\nI know people think I'm na\u00efve. My ex certainly did\u2014said I 'lived in a fantasy world.' Maybe I do trust too easily. But I'd rather believe in people and be wrong sometimes than go through life assuming the worst. That's not na\u00efve, that's a choice.",

I wasn't thick, but I wasn't destined for university either. Left at sixteen, worked the tills at the precinct for a bit, then fell into cleaning. Twenty-three years now. I do offices mostly\u2014the Friargate business district, some of the new builds near the station. People look right through you when you're pushing a mop. They'll have whole conversations about redundancies while you're emptying their bins. You learn a lot being invisible.\n\nI figured out I was non-binary in my late thirties, though I didn't have the words for it back then. Just knew 'woman' never fit right, like wearing shoes two sizes too small. These days I use they/them with the few people who bother to ask. The clients call me 'love' or 'darling' and I let it slide. Battles worth fighting and all that.\n\nI need this money because my boiler's been on its last legs since 2019 and the landlord won't fix it.

Dad was never really in the picture\u2014he sent birthday cards from Swindon until I was about twelve, then nothing. Mum worked doubles to keep us afloat, so I spent most of my childhood at the local library or poking about in charity shops looking for weird things. Found a Victorian mourning brooch once with a lock of hair in it. I was hooked.\n\nDid my A-levels at Worthing College, then scraped into Sussex for Museum Studies. Everyone said I was mad\u2014'there's no money in that, love'\u2014but I didn't care. I volunteered at the Booth Museum every weekend for two years before they finally gave me a paid position as a Collections Assistant. Twenty-three quid an hour to catalogue dead birds and answer questions about the Merman. Absolute dream, honestly.\n\nExcept now the Booth's closing for refurbishment in April, and nobody's telling us if we've got jobs after. I'm living in a shared house in Hanover with four other people\u2014one bathroom, mould on the ceiling, but the rent's still seven hundred a month. I need this money to put a deposit on somewhere that isn't slowly giving me a chest infection. Plus, I'd love to do my Masters properly instead of hoping for funding that never comes.\n\nPeople say I'm odd. I prefer 'specific.' I notice things others don't\u2014like when someone's smile doesn't reach their eyes, or when a taxidermied stoat's been posed wrong. I say 'slippery fish' instead of plastic wallet, because that's what my nan called them and I'm not stopping now.",

Did my Masters in Behavioural Science at UCL, then fell into UX research because that's where the jobs were.

    "backstory": "I was born in Edinburgh but we moved around\u2014father was in the Foreign Office. Boarding school at Oundle, then Cambridge for Engineering, then twenty-five years in cybersecurity before anyone called it that. I've led teams at GCHQ, consulted for the NCSC, and for the last eight years I've been what they politely call a 'Team Captain'\u2014Chief Technology Officer in practice, though the title sounds less threatening.\n\nI live in Hale Barns now, south of Manchester, in a house with too many bedrooms since the children left. My wife Eleanor runs a charity; my son James is a barrister in London; my daughter Sophie does something with sustainable fashion I don't quite understand but admire enormously. I'm fifty-three, and I've reached the stage where I've achieved most of what I set out to achieve and I'm wondering what's next.\n\nI'm obsessive about health\u2014up at five, cold shower, breathing exercises, the whole biohacking nonsense. I've read the studies. It works. I drink Highland Spring, avoid processed food, and haven't had a sick day in eight years. People find it insufferable. Eleanor certainly does.\n\nThe money isn't about need\u2014I'm comfortable. It's about competition. I've spent my career in rooms where being the smartest wasn't enough; you had to prove it. This is another room. Another test. I don't intend to lose.",
    "key_relationships": [
      "Eleanor Whitmore (wife, 51) - twenty-eight years married; she grounds me when I get too intense, which is often; I love her but I don't tell her enough",
      "James (son, 27) - brilliant but driven in ways that remind me uncomfortably of myself at his age; we argue about work-life balance while both ignoring ours",
      "General Sir Patrick Bourne (retired, family friend) - my mentor, now in his seventies; he taught me that leadership is service, even when it doesn't feel like it"
    ],
    "formative_challenge": "In 2008, I led a cybersecurity team during a major government breach. We contained it, eventually, but one of my team\u2014someone I'd trusted, championed, promoted\u2014had been compromised. Not maliciously; she'd been manipulated by a foreign actor exploiting a family situation. I had to make the call that ended her career. She was escorted out the same day. I was right to do it, operationally. I still think about whether I handled the human side correctly. The answer is probably no. Trust became transactional for me after that.",
    "political_beliefs": "I'm a pragmatic centrist who votes based on competence rather than ideology, which means I'm perpetually disappointed. I believe in institutions, in proper process, in the quiet work of civil servants who don't make headlines. I'm skeptical of populism from any direction. In the game, I'll value strategy over emotion and order over chaos. I'll probably come across as cold or calculating because I am, a bit. I've learned to see people as variables in systems, which is useful professionally and damaging personally.",
    "hobbies": [
      "Competitive sailing\u2014I keep a yacht at Lymington and race in the Solent Series; there's nothing like being at the helm in a Force 5",
      "Chess\u2014I play correspondence games online through ScotNet and I'm rated around 2100; middling for competition, but it keeps the mind sharp",
      "Collecting vintage military watches\u2014I have a 1960s Omega Seamaster that belonged to my grandfather"
    ],
    "strategic_approach": "I'll treat this like an operational problem. Who has access? Who has motive? What are the patterns? I'll build intelligence networks, cross-reference what people say with how they act, and avoid emotional attachments that could compromise my judgment. If I'm a Faithful, I'll be effective at analysis but might miss social dynamics I consider 'irrational.' If I'm a Traitor, I'll compartmentalize ruthlessly\u2014warm Charlie in public, strategic Charlie in private. My weakness is I can seem detached, robotic. People don't trust leaders who don't appear to feel anything.",
