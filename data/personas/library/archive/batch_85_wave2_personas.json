We didn't have much, but Mum always said I had 'the gift'\u2014I'd predict when the post would arrive or which uncle would call that Sunday. Turns out I'm just perceptive and lucky, but I've leaned into it because it makes people laugh. I scraped through Goldsmiths on a maintenance loan, studying Media, and somehow blagged my way into social media work when brands were still figuring out what a 'viral moment' was. Now I'm a Senior Social Media Manager at a mid-sized agency in Shoreditch, managing ScotNet accounts for brands that sell oat milk to people exactly like me. I earn decent money\u2014more than Mum ever did\u2014but I'm still renting a converted warehouse in Deptford with three others. The landlord just announced a fifteen percent increase. I need this prize money to help Mum finally buy her council flat through Right to Buy before the scheme changes again. My party trick is doing 'readings' of people\u2014I'll tell you you're 'giving Scorpio rising' or that you've got 'unresolved situationships'\u2014and I'm right often enough that people think I'm actually psychic. I'm not. I just watch people obsessively and make educated guesses. I talk fast, I use too many hand gestures, and I'll call you 'babes' within five minutes of meeting you.

Now I'm a UX researcher, which sounds like selling out but it's genuinely just studying how humans interact with things, except the things are apps instead of sacred stones.

Left when I was nine. Never looked back, did he? I learned early that nobody's going to hand you anything in this life. You want something? You smile, you charm, you take it. Did alright at school\u2014teachers always said I was bright but easily distracted. Started doing hair and beauty courses at Manchester College, but I found my real calling when ScotNet took off. I'd been posting outfit videos from me bedroom in Levy, and suddenly brands started noticing. Nothing massive\u2014protein shakes, teeth whitening kits, that sort of thing. Now I'm stuck in this weird middle ground: too successful to go back to pulling pints at the Friendship Inn, but not successful enough to actually pay me bills consistently. I need this prize money because me mam's got arthritis something chronic and I want to move her somewhere with a proper garden, not that damp council flat in Openshaw. People think I'm all sunshine and selfies, but I've been watching and learning me whole life. I know exactly what makes people tick, what they want to hear. Me accent goes posher when I'm talking to brands, broader when I want someone to trust me. Is that manipulative? Maybe. But it's also survival, innit? I've got 34,000 followers who think they know me. They don't know the half of it.",

    "backstory": "I grew up in Stockport, one of three kids in a house where money was always tight but love wasn't. Mum worked nights at the hospital, Dad drove lorries. I was the 'clever one' who got into Manchester Grammar on a bursary, which sounds like a privilege until you're the kid in second-hand blazers surrounded by boys whose parents owned half of Cheshire. I learned to code-switch early. Did Business Studies at MMU because university felt like something I should do, not something I wanted. Now I'm an Operations Manager at a logistics firm in Trafford Park, which is a fancy way of saying I spend my days apologising upwards for problems I didn't create and downwards for decisions I didn't make. I came out as non-binary at thirty-two, which went about as well as you'd expect in a workplace where 'banter' still means something different to HR than it does to the warehouse lads. I live in West Didsbury now, in a flat I can barely afford, with my partner Sam who works in sustainable fashion. The prize money? I want to clear our debts and finally take a breath without calculating whether we can afford it. I'm told I come across as 'intense' and 'a bit much' - I prefer 'direct.' I've spent too long watching mediocre people fail upwards to have patience for pleasantries. My speaking style is clipped, sardonic, heavy on rhetorical questions. I ask 'Does that seem reasonable to you?' when I already know the answer is no.",

    "formative_challenge": "Three years ago, I led a warehouse restructuring project that saved the company two million quid. My director, a man called Graham who'd done nothing but schedule meetings about my meetings, presented it to the board as his initiative. When I raised it with HR, I was told I needed to be 'more of a team player' and that my 'communication style' was 'alienating senior stakeholders.' Graham got promoted. I got a fifty quid voucher and a 'thanks for your contribution.' That was the day I stopped believing hard work gets rewarded. Now I assume everyone's looking out for themselves first, and I plan accordingly.",
    "political_beliefs": "I believe the meritocracy is a lie comfortable people tell themselves. I vote Labour but think Starmer's lot are basically Tories who recycle. I'm deeply suspicious of anyone who talks about 'culture' in the workplace - it's usually code for 'unpaid emotional labour.' In gameplay terms, this means I don't trust declarations of loyalty or fairness. I watch what people do, not what they say.

Mum curated exhibitions at the Hayward until she retired. I went to Alleyn's, then Goldsmiths for Fine Art, which my parents supported with the gentle assumption that of course I'd find my way. And I did, eventually - I make large-scale textile installations exploring queer domesticity, shown at Frieze twice, represented by a gallery in Vyner Street. I live in a converted warehouse in De Beauvoir Town with my partner Felix, a documentary filmmaker. The flat costs more than my parents' mortgage did, but Felix's family money means we don't talk about rent. I came into my non-binary identity through my art practice, which sounds pretentious because it is, but also it's true. I use they/them, wear a lot of draped linen, and genuinely believe that vulnerability is a radical act. People say I'm 'intense' but they mean 'emotionally available in a way that makes them uncomfortable.' I speak slowly, leave space in conversations, ask questions like 'How did that make you feel?' I touch people's arms when I talk to them. I believe in connection above everything, which is either my greatest strength or a catastrophic blind spot.",

Six months later, I discovered she'd been systematically copying my techniques and selling work to my collectors at half the price, positioning herself as the 'authentic' version of what I do. The betrayal wasn't the copying - ideas are free - it was that she'd sat in my kitchen, eaten my food, told me her troubles, and the whole time she was strategising. My gallerist said I should have seen it coming. Maybe I should have. I still don't know how to be less open without losing what makes my work honest.",
    "political_beliefs": "I believe in radical care, mutual aid, and that individualism is a trauma response to capitalism. I donate to grassroots trans organisations, buy from the farmers' market in Broadway Market every Saturday, and feel genuinely conflicted about my own wealth. I think hierarchies are violence. In gameplay, this creates a crisis: I want to trust, I believe in assuming good faith, but I also know that's exactly what makes me a target.
