## **A Comprehensive Framework for LLM-Driven Reality TV Simulation**

***

## **Game Mechanics and Rulebook**

### Core Game Structure

The Traitors is a psychological reality competition where players are divided into two roles: **Traitors** (a secret minority) and **Faithfuls** (the majority) [1]. The game operates on a dual-elimination system where Traitors secretly "murder" Faithfuls each night, while all players vote to "banish" suspected Traitors at daily Round Tables [2].

Initial Traitor selection occurs before gameplay begins, with contestants hand-picked by the host without the knowledge of other players [2]. Production typically ensures diversity in the initial Traitor group, maintaining at least one male and one female Traitor, and usually including a person of color [3]. The total number of Traitors is never revealed to Faithfuls and can change through banishment or recruitment [1].

### Daily Gameplay Cycle

Each game day follows a structured rhythm [4]:

**Morning Reveal**: Players gather to discover which Faithful was murdered overnight. The murdered contestant does not appear at the castle, creating immediate tension and paranoia [2].

**Mission Phase**: The group participates in mental and physical challenges designed to add money to the prize pot, which can reach up to £120,000 [5][6]. Missions serve dual purposes: building the financial prize and providing respites from strategic gameplay [5].

**Round Table**: Players engage in heated discussions and confrontations about suspected Traitors [2]. Following debate, each player privately votes to banish one contestant. The player with the most votes is immediately banished and must reveal whether they are a Traitor or Faithful [1].

**Murder Phase**: After the Round Table, surviving Traitors meet in secret to select a Faithful to eliminate [2].

### Special Mechanics

**Shields**: Mission winners can earn Shields that protect from the next murder attempt, but NOT from banishment votes [2]. In UK/US versions (Season 2+), shields are won through direct mission competition rather than random Armoury draws. Shield holders typically keep possession secret to prevent Traitors from selecting alternative targets [7].

**Regional Shield Variant**: In the Australian version, Shields provide enhanced protection against BOTH murder AND banishment—the only version with this rule.

**Seer Power** (UK Series 3+, US Season 3+): A late-game power that allows one player to privately confirm another contestant's true role (Traitor or Faithful). Won through mission performance, the Seer meets privately with their chosen target who must reveal their role truthfully. However, both players can fabricate any narrative about what happened afterward to other contestants. This power replaced the Dagger in UK/US versions [19].

**Dagger** (International versions only): Grants double voting power at the next Round Table. Used in Canada, France, Netherlands, Norway, and other European versions, but notably ABSENT from UK and US versions. When available, typically offered as a choice: mission winner picks Shield OR Dagger (not both).

**Recruitment**: When a Traitor is banished, remaining Traitors may recruit a Faithful to join them instead of committing a murder that night [1][8]. Face-to-face recruitment occurs when only one Traitor remains—the approached Faithful must either accept (becoming a Traitor) or decline (resulting in immediate murder) [8]. Recruited players become Traitors for the remainder of their time in the game [1].

**No Murder Rule**: When a Traitor is banished, no murder occurs that night if recruitment is exercised [9]. At final five, production typically prevents murders to ensure proper endgame structure [3].

**Death List / On Trial** (Optional mechanic): When Traitors have been "too efficient at murdering," this mechanic restricts their choices. Traitors must pre-select 3-4 murder candidates during their Tower visit—only these nominees can be murdered that night. Shield still protects even if On Trial. Traitors can nominate themselves for strategic complexity. Used in: US, Australia, UK, Canada, Netherlands, Norway.

**Recruitment Variants**:
- **Standard** (UK/Dutch/US): Faithful can decline; declined recruitment wastes the night (no murder)
- **Ultimatum** (UK Series 1+): Last Traitor offers "join or die"—declining means immediate murder
- **Blackmail** (Norway): Forced recruitment with no option to decline

### Endgame Protocol

When only four players remain, they participate in a final challenge followed by a critical vote [2]. Each player chooses either "End Game" or "Banish Again." A unanimous "End Game" vote concludes the competition immediately [2]. If consensus isn't reached, another banishment vote occurs before repeating the choice between ending or continuing [2].

**Victory Conditions**:
- If all remaining players at game end are Faithfuls, they equally share the prize money [1][2]
- If any Traitors remain, they take the entire prize pot [2]

Production maintains at least two Traitors at final six to ensure compelling endgame drama [3].

**2025 Rule Change**: In the latest seasons, eliminated endgame players NO LONGER reveal their role (Traitor or Faithful). This forces remaining contestants to rely purely on intuition and prior observations when deciding whether to End Game or continue banishing. Previously, seeing eliminations reveal "I was a Faithful" helped remaining players gauge remaining Traitor count.

**International Endgame Variants**:
- **Vote to End** (UK/US standard): Unanimous vote required to end game. If anyone votes "Banish Again," another Round Table occurs.
- **Traitor's Dilemma** (Australia Season 2): If final players are both Traitors, they play Share/Steal between themselves before prize division.
- **Prisoner's Dilemma** (Netherlands original format): ALL finalists (Traitors and Faithfuls) participate in Share/Steal mechanic affecting prize distribution.

**Tie-Breaking Procedures** (when Round Table votes are tied):
- **Revote** (UK/US default): New vote with ONLY tied players eligible. Original voters can switch allegiances.
- **Countback** (Netherlands/some international): Player with most cumulative votes across entire season is eliminated.
- **Random Draw** (fallback): If tie persists after revote, random selection occurs. Rarely used in production.

### Regional Rule Summary

| Region | Players | Traitors | Dagger | Seer | Shield Power | Recruitment | Endgame |
|--------|---------|----------|--------|------|--------------|-------------|---------|
| **UK** | 22-25 | 3 | No | Yes (S3+) | Murder only | Standard/Ultimatum | Vote to End |
| **US** | 20-23 | 3-4 | No | Yes (S3+) | Murder only | Standard | Vote to End |
| **Australia** | 20-24 | 3-4 | Rare | No | Murder + Banishment | Standard | Traitor's Dilemma |
| **Canada** | 20 | 3 | Yes | No | Murder only | Ultimatum | Vote to End |
| **Netherlands** | 20 | 3 | Yes | No | Murder only | Standard | Prisoner's Dilemma |
| **Norway** | 20 | 3 | Yes | No | Murder only | Blackmail | Vote to End |

**Key Differences**:
- UK/US use Seer power instead of Dagger for late-game mechanics
- Australia has most powerful Shield (blocks both murder AND banishment)
- Netherlands/Norway allow Dagger but have different endgame dynamics
- UK always uses exactly 3 Traitors; US and Australia may use 4 in larger casts

## **Spatial Graph and Castle Layout**

### The Castle Environment

The game unfolds at **Ardross Castle**, a 19th-century Scottish Baronial structure located 25-30 miles north of Inverness in the Scottish Highlands [10][11]. The castle sits within over 100 acres of parkland along the River Alness, surrounded by formal gardens, rolling hills, and misty Highland glens [12][10].

### Atmospheric Elements

The production creates immersive medieval ambiance through strategic sensory design [13]. Fire teams maintain torches and wood fires throughout the castle, producing distinctive smells that psychologically ground players in the historic setting [13]. Candlelit Round Tables, sweeping staircases, intricate rooflines, turrets, and battlement-like architectural features contribute to the Gothic atmosphere [14][11].

### Key Locations and Their Functions

**Round Table Chamber**: The primary location for public confrontation and banishment votes. Features dramatic candlelit setup with Gothic ambiance [14]. Designed for maximum psychological pressure during accusations and debates. Interaction multiplier: High (group dynamics intensified).

**Traitors' Turret**: Secret meeting room accessible only to Traitors for murder discussions and strategic planning [2]. Complete privacy required; no Faithful access. This space creates the show's central deception mechanic.

**Breakfast Hall/Dining Room**: Morning gathering location where players discover who was murdered overnight [2]. Moderate privacy level; designed for group meals and initial daily reactions.

**Castle Grounds**: Expansive outdoor areas used for physical missions and team challenges [5][11]. Over 100 acres of parkland, gardens, and natural Highland terrain. Variable privacy; allows for alliance formation during mission downtime.

**Individual Quarters**: Private sleeping areas where players rest between game phases. High privacy; minimal interaction unless specifically visiting another player's room.

**Mission Zones**: Designated areas within grounds or castle rooms for specific challenges. Can include water features, obstacle courses, timed puzzle areas, and strategic challenge spaces [7].

## **Social Dynamics and Casting Archetypes**

### Core Archetypes

**The Misguided Survivor**: Players who conflate longevity with skill, failing to recognize they're kept around due to incompetence rather than strategic value [15]. These contestants provide comedy and eventual satisfying downfalls. Strategic drive: Survival over strategy.

**The Comedic Psychic**: Attention-seeking players who make wild accusations and dramatic pronouncements about Traitor identities [15]. Often eliminated quickly due to disruptive antics. Strategic drive: Entertainment and spotlight.

**The Bitter Traitor**: Banished Traitors who leave breadcrumbs pointing to their former allies out of spite [15]. This archetype creates dramatic tension and strategic complications for remaining Traitors.

**The Infatuated Faithful**: Players whose romantic interest in a Traitor clouds their judgment, leading to disastrous decisions for the Faithful team [15]. Strategic drive: Emotional connection over logic.

**The Quirky Outsider**: Neurodivergent or unconventional players who face undue suspicion simply for not conforming to expected behavior patterns [15]. Often misread by other contestants.

**The Charming Sociopath**: Charismatic Traitors whose good looks and magnetic personalities allow them to evade detection despite erratic behavior [15]. Strategic drive: Manipulation through charm.

**The Incompetent Authority Figure**: Retired law enforcement or military personnel who play so poorly it raises concerns about their professional competence [15]. Often trusted initially due to perceived credibility.

**The Prodigy**: Exceptionally skilled Faithfuls who excel at identifying Traitors but are eliminated before the finale due to being threats [15]. Strategic drive: Truth-seeking and logical deduction.

**The Zealot**: Players who immerse themselves completely in their role (Traitor or Faithful), taking it on as core personality [15]. High conviction; potentially sanctimonious.

**The Romantic**: Believes being a Traitor is inherently evil; assumes friends would never betray them [15]. Often overlaps with the "jock-lover" who equates mission performance with Faithful status.

**The Smug Player**: Can manifest as either Smug Traitor or Smug Faithful [15]. Exhibits moral superiority, admonishing others for unethical play or "dirty" tactics.

**The Mischievous Operator**: Embodied by players who employ Machiavellian tactics, form overt alliances, and clearly enjoy the thrill of deception [16]. Bend truth regularly; charismatic manipulators.

**The Aloof Wanderer**: Exudes relaxed demeanor, appears indifferent, may not fully grasp game rules [17]. Cheerful and youthful; personality remains consistent regardless of role.

**The Charismatic Leader**: Highly valued team member with strong influence over Round Table discussions [17]. As Faithful, poses significant threat to Traitors; as Traitor, easily misleads others while concealing intentions.

***

## **Global Flavor and Lore (In-Game Universe)**

### Cultural Setting

The game exists within a heightened reality where **Highland Gothic** aesthetics merge with contemporary British culture. The castle serves as a liminal space removed from ordinary life, where Victorian grandeur meets modern psychological warfare [18].

### Historical Context

The Scottish Highlands carry a legacy of deception, treachery, and illusion [18]. The *Gàidhealtachd* (Highlands and islands of Scotland) provides thematically appropriate backdrop for a game centered on trust and betrayal. The region's association with controversial historical figures—including the first Duke of Sutherland connected to Highland Clearances—adds layers of thematic resonance to the castle's use [18][11].

### In-Universe Brands and Products

To avoid real-world references, the simulation should employ fictional equivalents:

**Food and Beverage**:
- **Highland Spring Co.** (water)
- **Cairngorm Coffee Roasters** (coffee brand)
- **Heather & Thistle Crisps** (snacks)
- **Loch Provisions** (meal supplier)
- **Royal Oak Spirits** (alcoholic beverages)

**Clothing and Personal Items**:
- **Baronial Casual Wear** (everyday clothing)
- **Tartan & Stone Outfitters** (outdoor mission gear)
- **Inverness Essentials** (toiletries)

**Entertainment and Communication**:
- **CastleVision** (in-universe production company)
- **The Highland Herald** (newspaper references)
- **ScotNet** (internet/social media equivalent)

### Game Show Lore

Previous simulated seasons should include legendary moments that agents can reference:

**Season 1 ("The Aberdeen Blindside")**: A charismatic Traitor convinced the entire group to banish their strongest Faithful ally, only to be exposed in the final four when a recruited Faithful turned on them.

**Season 2 ("The Edinburgh Strategy")**: Three Traitors made it to final five but imploded due to internal paranoia, with two Traitors banishing the third, leading to Faithful victory.

**Season 3 ("The Inverness Gambit")**: A single Traitor survived from final ten to final three by successfully recruiting twice and playing both sides against each other.

These references create a sense of game history and strategic precedent that sophisticated players might invoke.

## **Agent Persona and Backstory Guidelines**

### Required Demographic Fields

Each agent must have complete demographic grounding to behave authentically:

**Age**: Specify exact age (typically 20-65) with consideration for generational perspective and life experience.

**Geographic Origin**: Include specific UK region (e.g., Manchester, Glasgow, Cardiff, Belfast, London) or international background with immigration story. Regional accents, cultural references, and local pride should inform dialogue.

**Occupation**: Detailed current profession with specific workplace context (e.g., "NHS nurse specializing in emergency pediatrics at Royal Manchester Children's Hospital" rather than generic "nurse").

**Socioeconomic Background**: Class markers, educational attainment, economic stability, and cultural capital inform worldview and strategic approach.

**Ethnicity and Cultural Heritage**: Specific cultural background (e.g., British-Bangladeshi, Scottish-Pakistani, Afro-Caribbean British) shapes identity, potential microaggressions faced, and community connections.

### OCEAN Personality Traits

Each agent requires scored personality dimensions on 1-10 scale:

**Openness**: Willingness to try new strategies, creativity in deception, comfort with ambiguity
**Conscientiousness**: Organization, rule-following, methodical gameplay vs. chaotic approach
**Extraversion**: Social energy, alliance-building capability, comfort in group settings
**Agreeableness**: Cooperation tendency, conflict avoidance, empathy levels
**Neuroticism**: Emotional stability under pressure, anxiety responses, paranoia susceptibility

These scores should directly influence strategic decision-making and social interactions.

### Backstory Elements

**Key Relationships**: Define 2-3 significant people in agent's life (partner, parent, best friend, child) who motivate them. Include specific anecdotes and emotional stakes for winning prize money.

**Formative Trauma or Challenge**: Past experiences that shaped personality (e.g., financial hardship, betrayal by friend, overcoming discrimination, family loss). This informs trust issues, resilience, and trigger points.

**Political Leanings**: Specific positions on social issues, political party affiliation or independence, and how this affects perceptions of fairness, authority, and morality in game context.

**Religious/Philosophical Background**: Spiritual beliefs or secular philosophy that inform ethical boundaries, approach to deception, and judgment of others' behavior.

**Hobbies and Interests**: Specific passions (beyond generic "travel" or "fitness") that provide conversation material and bonding opportunities with other players.

**Strategic Motivation**: Clear articulation of why they're playing (debt elimination, family support, business startup, proving themselves) with specific monetary goals and backup plans.

### Grounding in Research Findings

Personas should reflect contemporary UK reality TV culture [15][17]. Recent seasons demonstrate increased diversity in age, regional representation, and neurodivergent contestants [15]. Agents should avoid anachronistic references and maintain cultural authenticity to their stated backgrounds.

***

## **Narrative Orchestration and Director Agent Rules**

### The Host/Director Role

The host (in official versions, Claudia Winkleman) serves as game orchestrator, maintaining Gothic dramatic tension through presentation style and twist introduction [2][14]. In simulation, a Director Agent must:

**Maintain Game Balance**: Ensure at least two Traitors survive to final six [3]. Monitor Faithful/Traitor ratio and introduce recruitment opportunities or strategic twists to prevent early Traitor elimination.

**Trigger Twists**: Introduce shields, special recruitment scenarios, or surprise mission formats when gameplay becomes predictable or one-sided [2][7].

**Summarize Key Moments**: After each Round Table, the Director Agent should generate narrative summaries capturing: most compelling arguments, shifting alliances, emotional peaks, and strategic miscalculations [2].

**Manage Pacing**: Ensure missions provide strategic value beyond money-building [5]. Design challenges that reveal character, force difficult choices (e.g., shields vs. money), and create bonding or conflict opportunities.

**Enforce Cardinal Rules**: Traitors must never directly reveal their identity to Faithfuls [19]. Recruitment offers are the only exception, occurring in controlled scenarios [8].

### Twist Timing Guidelines

**Early Game (Days 1-4)**: Establish baseline dynamics; minimal interference. Allow natural alliance formation and initial strategic patterns to emerge.

**Mid Game (Days 5-8)**: Introduce shields, special missions with moral dilemmas, or recruitment opportunities when Traitor numbers drop to one or two [1][20].

**Late Game (Days 9+)**: Maintain tension through final mission stakes, potential surprise returns (though rare), and ensure final four setup allows for dramatic endgame [2][3].

### Narrative Documentation

The Director Agent should maintain running documentation of:

**Alliance Map**: Who trusts whom, identified sub-groups, and shifting loyalty patterns
**Strategic Moves Log**: Significant gameplay decisions, successful deceptions, and critical errors
**Emotional Arc Tracking**: Character development, relationship evolution, and breaking points
**Audience-Worthy Moments**: Quotable lines, dramatic confrontations, and blindside reactions suitable for highlight reels

This documentation ensures consistent character behavior and creates rich narrative texture across episodes.
